## Emma Vasudevan

I am a consultant econometrician (MAppEmet, University of Queensland), with a background in civil engineering. I have a keen interest in developing and increasing social good by identifying and fostering opportunities with benefits to both communities and organisations.

Recently, I owned and was the CFO for Queensland Cheer Elite, growing the business to the largest in Australia. With a strong ability to process complex information and data through an analytical lens, as well as working across functions to bring an idea to life, I am the type of person who follows my own compass with great tenacity and finds value in converting personal interests into professional careers.
